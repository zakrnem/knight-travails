+ Create function for getting the shortest path between two gameboard cells.
    Level order might the fastest traversal to finding the shortest path.


Find the soughtOrdinate with BFS, stop the search when the desired node is found.
Push the desired node into a path array.
Get the predecessor, push it into the path array.
Iterate until predecessor is equal to null.
